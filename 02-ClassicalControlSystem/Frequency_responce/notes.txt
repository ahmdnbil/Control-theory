logspace(-1,2,1000)
it will get 1000 number between -1 & 2 each number is power of 10
for example [10^-1 to 10^(2)]

[H, w]=freqresp(sys,frequencies)
frequencies: which we got from logspace it will be substitute to sys in form of "sinsouidal TF"
H: will be the vector resulted from substitution
w: is the frequency you have entered
for example sys = 1/s in sin form sys_sin=1/jw then sub w with each frequency

squeeze: remove unnessary dimensions
